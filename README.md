This is a repository set up to separate out my professional webpage (which will theoretically look serious, and contain, e.g. my CV etc.) from things I feel like experimenting with on github pages. 

The IPA trap game linked is an in-progress HTML/CSS/JavaScript version of Nathan Sander's IPA trap game (which was conceptually interesting, but not actually functional as far as checking whether you'd broken the rules or not). It doesn't currently do anything, but someday it might!
